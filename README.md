Overview
This project focuses on building predictive models to understand the factors affecting car prices in the U.S. automobile market. A Chinese automobile company is looking to enter the U.S. market, and they need insights into how various factors influence car pricing. The goal is to develop machine learning models that predict car prices based on available independent variables, with the ability to adjust their business strategy and design accordingly.

Objectives
Predict car prices based on various features of the car.
Identify significant variables that affect the car prices.
Evaluate multiple regression models and select the best one based on performance metrics.
Perform feature importance analysis to highlight which factors contribute the most to the price.
Apply hyperparameter tuning to enhance the performance of the best model.
Dataset
The dataset consists of various car features and their corresponding prices in the American market. The data was gathered through market surveys. The dataset is available here.

Key Steps
1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset and handled missing values.
Performed One-Hot Encoding on categorical variables to convert them into numerical values.
Standardized numerical features to ensure models perform optimally.
2. Model Implementation
Implemented the following five regression algorithms:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
3. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models based on the following metrics:

R-squared (RÂ²): Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average absolute error between actual and predicted values.
4. Feature Importance Analysis
Identified which variables are significant in predicting car prices. This helps the company understand which features (such as brand, engine type, or car model) have the most influence on price.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Performed hyperparameter tuning for models like Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor using GridSearchCV to find optimal parameters and improve model performance.
Conclusion
The best performing model was identified based on evaluation metrics, with a justification for why it performed better.
Feature importance analysis revealed key variables that affect car prices in the U.S. market.
Hyperparameter tuning resulted in better performance for certain models, improving the predictive power of the selected model.
