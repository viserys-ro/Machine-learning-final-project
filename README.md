Machine learning final project
Project Summary: Predicting Car Prices for the US Market
Objective
A Chinese automobile company aims to enter the US market by establishing a local manufacturing unit and producing cars tailored to American consumers. To achieve this, they need to understand the factors influencing car prices in the US market. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to analyze how independent variables affect car prices and provide actionable insights for the company's business strategy.

Key Components
Loading and Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset from the provided link.

Performed necessary preprocessing steps:

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Scaled numerical features for consistency.

Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

Model Implementation

Implemented five regression algorithms:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor

Trained and evaluated each model using the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation

Compared the performance of all models using:

R-squared (R²): To measure the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): To quantify the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To measure the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

Identified the best-performing model based on these metrics.

Feature Importance Analysis

Analyzed the significant variables affecting car prices using feature importance from the best-performing model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting).

Provided insights into which features (e.g., engine size, horsepower, brand) have the most impact on car prices.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Performed hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing model using GridSearchCV.

Evaluated whether tuning improved the model's performance (e.g., higher R², lower MSE/MAE).

Results
Best Performing Model: Random Forest Regressor (or Gradient Boosting Regressor, depending on evaluation results).

Key Insights:

The most significant features influencing car prices in the US market are [list top features, e.g., engine size, brand, horsepower].

Hyperparameter tuning improved the model's performance, achieving [specific metrics, e.g., R² = 0.90, MSE = 1000].

Business Implications:

The company can focus on optimizing the significant features (e.g., engine size, brand reputation) to meet target price levels.

The model provides a clear understanding of pricing dynamics in the US market, enabling informed decisions on car design and business strategy.
